## Week-1 : Learning the HDL-Hardware Description Language Verilog HDL.

### Major topics:
<ol>
<li>Verilog language details</li>
<li>Differences between simulation and synthesis</li>
<li>Various modelling styles</li>
<li>Modelling of combinational logic</li>
<li>Modelling of sequential logic</li>
<li>FSM design</li>
</ol>

### Types of modelling

- [Gate-level modelling](https://github.com/dicdesign/workshop_may6th_25th_2024/tree/main/week1/gateLevelModelling)
- [Dataflow level modelling](https://github.com/dicdesign/workshop_may6th_25th_2024/tree/main/week1/dataFlowModelling)
- [Structural modelling](https://github.com/dicdesign/workshop_may6th_25th_2024/tree/main/week1/structuralModelling) 

### Demonstration of how to write simulation results to file.
